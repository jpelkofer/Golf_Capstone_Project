# Golf Capstone Project
The daily fantasy sports and sports betting industries are growing rapidly. Daily fantasy golf is no exception. DraftKings, the most popular daily fantasy site, awards millions in prize money each week for PGA Tour daily fantasy contests. This paper develops a framework to be successful in these contests. Building off prior golf and daily fantasy research a simulation model is developed to predict the performance of golfers in an upcoming tournament. Using summary statistics from the simulation model, optimal DraftKings lineups are constructed based on the rules of constructing a lineup. These lineups were entered into two types of contests offered by DraftKings, guaranteed prize pool tournaments and double ups. The optimal lineups performed poorly in the double up contests but outperformed the competition in guaranteed prize pool tournaments. One model/optimal lineup combination generated a return on investment over 300% and several others had ROIs over 100%. The models also significantly outperformed optimal lineups that were constructed using Vegas odds for golfers prior to the tournament. The results of this research validated prior research that supported daily fantasy as a game of skill. The code used to get the data, build the models, and construct the lineups is all available in this repo.
